## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Navigate seamlessly through different pages using the React Router
- Interact with dynamic components such as the Hamburger Menu and Contact Form
- View actual locations on the locations page maps using [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/)

- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- React - JS library
- React Router - For routing

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This project was a great opportunity to practice React and React Router for creating a multi-page website. One of the key takeaways was managing state and props across different components to create a cohesive and interactive user experience. Implementing the Hamburger Menu on mobile views was particularly challenging and rewarding.

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to focus more on accessibility and SEO best practices to ensure the websites I build are user-friendly and performant. Additionally, I'm interested in exploring more advanced state management solutions like Redux or the Context API in React to handle more complex application states.
